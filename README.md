# Ava Assistant AI [Work in Progress]

Multiplatform voice assistant that handles daily user tasks using OpenAI custom assistants.

## Description

Ava Assistant AI is a voice assistant that uses speech recognition and it's own voice to interact and communicate with users. Ava is very basic at the moment but will be improved over time.

>[!Note]
> Uses [pyaimanager](https://github.com/joe-gutman/pyaimanager), made by me, as the library to communicate with the OpenAI assistants.
